# Code cleanliness TODOS:

Review CSS, see if you can make it better

Organize utils.ts perhaps move some repetitive functionality out of components in to utility functions

Large scale review of DRY code. Theres some repetition out there.

Clean up unnecessary comments, add constructive comments where applicable

Add error handling in the DOM with useState setters and etc

Make real readme

Add modals that can pop up on any features that are not enabled

Check CSS against figma design, I am noticing some small errors
