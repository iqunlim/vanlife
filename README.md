# Code cleanliness TODOS:

Review CSS, see if you can make it better
Check all useeffects, do we need all of them?
Organize utils.ts perhaps move some repetitive functionality out of components in to utility functions
Large scale review of DRY code. Theres some repetition out there.
Clean up unnecessary comments, add constructive comments where applicable
Add error handling in the DOM with useState setters and etc
Make real readme
Add modals that can pop up on any features that are not enabled
Check CSS against figma design, I am noticing some small errors
